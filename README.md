# Covid Hesitancy

__Research question:__ 
Can we determine a relationship between a county’s social vulnerability index (SVI), Surgo Covid-19 Vaccine Coverage Index (CVAC) and the percentage of residents who are extremely hesitant of the COVID-19 vaccine? 

__Data set:__
To explore this research question we will use [this](https://data.cdc.gov/Vaccinations/COVID-19-County-Hesitancy/c4bi-8ytd) dataset from the CDC, which describes the demographics, geography, percentage of people vaccinated against COVID-19 by county in the United States, and SVI by county. This dataset also describes the vaccine hesitancy by county, based on survey questions in the U.S. Census Bureau’s Household Pulse Survey.
